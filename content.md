# Course Content

This page includes all the content for the course thus far. We will update this page with all lecture materials, readings, and homework
as the class goes on.

## Schedule and Main Content

This class has six main modules, two for each "pillar" of machine learning: linear algebra, calculus  and optimization,
and probability and statistics. All class files will be available here. For a more detailed outline of the course thus 
far, see the [Course Skeleton]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link skeleton.md %})

- Lecture slides can be found by clicking on the lecture title for the appropriate day.
- All readings on the right column are **optional**, but reading (a subset of) these materials before each lecture might help digesting the content during lecture.
- Problem sets will be posted here, as well as their solutions.
